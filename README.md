# Scrollable-Video
A poor attempt at recreating the animation type of Apple's website.

Ok ok, so, I saw a few days ago on reddit that Apple's cool design for products were actually just hundreds of frames being played out. Which is super costly of the client's browser. So I decided to try to replicate the same thing, except instead of loading hundreds of pictures, I just loaded 1 video. It is super janky, but it technically works??
